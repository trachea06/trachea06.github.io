			<h2>Research</h2>
			<p>My research focuses on the culinary practices of Martian settlers, and how they have adapted to the harsh environment of their new home. Through interviews with Martian chefs and extensive taste-testing, I have discovered new ingredients, techniques, and recipes that could revolutionize the way we think about food.</p>
			<p>Some of my current research projects include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Exploring the potential uses of Martian fungi as a food source</li>
				<li>Investigating the role of spices in Martian cooking</li>
				<li>Developing new methods for growing crops in Martian soil</li>
			</ul>
